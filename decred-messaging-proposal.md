# Decred messaging proposal - the evolution of money

## Overview

There is a [new RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) on Politiea that invites the Decred community to submit ideas around Decred's messaging. 

This post will explore alternative ways of telling Decred's message to the world. 

The proposal [is live](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/02d9fc2) on Politeia.


## Thinking through messaging

In any narrative development there are typically four key stages. This approach used by @monsieurbulb gives structure to storytelling and it applies pretty much universally - from business to filmmaking and yes, even crypto-networks.

    Insight - the big picture, what is the context to the story you are telling?

    Problem - within the context you have framed, what is the primary issue?

    Solution - what is the compelling answer to the problem and context you have set?

    How it works - so now explain how the solution works, from high level to deep dive...


Example:

Let's take the (simplified) original positioning of the world's most famous computing brand.

    Insight - Computers will change the world but...

    Problem - Right now they are difficult to use...

    Solution - Introducing Apple. We make computers normal people can use.

    How it works - An intuitive human machine interface etc etc.

You can see how Apple benefitted from Steve Job's marketing insight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keCwRdbwNQY) and is where the 'Think Different' slogan was born from. Note that the slogan isn't about the technology, it's about what human sensibility the technology appeals to... He uses the same framework, the 'why' comes before the 'what'. 

Let's check Decred's positioning on the current website against this structure.

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value.

    How it works - It is secure. It is sustainable. It is adaptable.

Currently Decred's introduction misses two key steps - context and problem.

For many in the community those steps may be self-evident, but for newcomers and for those less well versed in the history of Bitcoin (aka the vast majority of crypto) it is much harder to grasp the key stages of the story.

An example revison of Decred's positioning statements.

    Insight - The existing financial system is inherently broken...

    Problem - There is no way to reliably store and transact value on the internet, BTC has failed to remain decentralized 

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value

    How it works - It is secure, it is sustainable, it is adaptable.

    Details... PoW/PoS hybrid system, treasury reward, Politeia...

The details above are on the website, but the narrative is not immediately clear.

Technology can be world leading, but if the story doesn't connect, the tech alone won't matter. The reverse is also true: great storytelling will take you a long way, but if there aren't strong foundations to back up your claims, then trust will be shortlived. 

#### Lessons to consider 

- The order of text really matters - prioritize.
- Aim for reduction and simplicity to create impact.
- Messaging is aimed at reaching and influencing - test it out.
- Narratives and marketing approaches constantly change over time. 
- Multiple narratives may coexist, this is something we [see in Bitcoin](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/) as well.

#### Key questions 

What is the core insight at the heart of the message? 

Which audience is the narrative aimed at and why? 


## Exploring new narratives 

Institutional investors such as [Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) and [Placeholder](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) (among others) have outlined their DCR investment theses and community members have offered [alternative narrative paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/). All these different ways of explaing Decred are relevant for this RFP.

It seems that there are 4 messaging categories, each with a different target audience: 

1. cypherpunk, privacy, security, autonomy, freedom, decentralization 
2. number go up, sound money, 21M max, store of value, profit, rewards
3. infrastructure, open source, reliable software, quality developers 
4. relatable stories, inspiration, positivity, celebrities, adoption

Remember: multiple different narratives can coexist. However, we will be more powerful when we create one overarching message that unifies the community.

#### Target audience 

Website copy should resonate with a regular middle class, non-oppressed person living in a (semi) developed nation state. 

The average crypto person...

- knows about "money printing" 
- thinks the financial system is rigged
- has fantasies about an "economic reset"
- feels governments are too bureaucratic 

and the younger archetype...

- is moderately skilled with computers
- knows memes and internet culture
- wants to show parents and friends how cool they are because they invest and make money online

Both archetypes are searching for blockchain projects that are innovative and groundbreaking. 

Some of these people may feel lonely in their daily lives and are looking for (online) communities they can belong to.


## Possible new messaging 

The core insight, to me, is that we live in disruptive times. All over the world we have seen protests, pandemics, rising unemployment, unprecedented money printing, and we are slowly witnessing a disintegration of our "normal" lifestyle.

We don't know how the world will change, but it doesn't look pretty.

The best way to predict the future is to build it together. 

Let's explore this narrative:

    Insights - We live in disruptive times. We can no longer rely on old systems to preserve our wealth and freedoms

    Problem - online collaboration to generate and preserve wealth is difficult, especially with random strangers

    Solution - introducing Decred, a DAO that was created to build a better financial future for our children 

    How it works - Decred is basically an evolved version of money:
    * instead of coins or cash we use decentralized credits (DCR)
    * you can choose to stake DCR to participate in governance and earn rewards
    * together, we make sure the project remains Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable 

Final narrative should be determined in collaboration with the wider community. 

#### Suggested website copy

[TAGLINE] Decred: Money Evolved

[BUTTONS] watch video + download wallet

[SIMPLE TEXT] (make it look fancy) 

We live in disruptive times.

We can no longer trust our banks.

National fiat currencies are controlled by elites. 

To create a better future, we need to evolve money.

The evolution of money requires global collaboration. 

This is why we need Decred. 

Decred is a decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO). 

We develop develop crypto technology for the public benefit.

Useful applications: [Decred DEX, Politeia, Lighting Network](https://github.com/decred/). 

Instead of coins or cash we use decentralized credits (DCR).

DCR can be used as a store of value and medium of exchange. 

You can stake DCR to get votes in governance and earn rewards.

Together we make sure that the project is Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable.

## About me

My story: [noahpierau.github.io](https://noahpierau.github.io/)

Community member since day 0.

- I received the Decred airdrop and never sold a single credit from it.
- I worked with _ingsoc and jz to build Decred's community from the ground up. 
- I helped several valued contractors get started with working for Decred. 
- I represented the project on social media and during offline events.


## Estimate of costs for changes + help required from others

I aim to change as little of the existing website as possible, only on the homepage and in other strategic places such as copy in link previews and social media descriptions.

I will co-create the new copy with the community. For free. The only costs go into design and implementation, to be done in collaboration with existing contractors such as @jholdstock.

As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.


## Costs

| Item           | Estimate | Maximum |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Design         | 200      | 350     |
| Translation    | 1100     | 1400    |
| Implementation | 200      | 350     |
| Total          | 1500     | 2100    |
